# Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that would be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.
 

# Example 1:

# Input:
# arr1[] = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
# arr2[] = {1, 4, 8, 10}
# k = 5
# Output:
# 6
# Explanation:
# The final sorted array would be -
# 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
# The 5th element of this array is 6.

# Example 2:

# Input:
# arr1[] = {100, 112, 256, 349, 770}
# arr2[] = {72, 86, 113, 119, 265, 445, 892}
# k = 7
# Output:
# 256
# Explanation:
# Final sorted array is - 72, 86, 100, 112,
# 113, 119, 256, 265, 349, 445, 770, 892
# 7th element of this array is 256.


# Your Task:  
# You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kthElement() which takes the arrays arr1[], arr2[], its size N and M respectively and an integer K as inputs and returns the element at the Kth position.


# Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N) + Log(M))
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log (N))

        high = min(k,n)
